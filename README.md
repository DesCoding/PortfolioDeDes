4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

    * Project title

    * Link to the deployed version

    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile

Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 




8. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

   * Title of app
   * Live link to deployed app
   * List of technologies used
   * 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is
   * 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app
   * License (usually MIT)
   * Contact information for you and any collaborators

9. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.
